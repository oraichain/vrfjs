# How to use VRF on Oraichain

## Prerequisites

- NPM
- Yarn (optional)

1. Install required libraries

First, we clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/oraichain/vrfjs.git

cd vrfjs
```

Then, we install the dependencies using `Yarn` (you can also use NPM):

```sh
yarn
```

2. Set your wallet via environment variable

Create a file named `.env`. Then, put your mnemonic phase there so you can trigger the transaction. For example:

```
MNEMONIC=foo bar hello world
```

3. Usage

```sh
yarn request-number
```

4. Advanced

The vrf logic is in the [vrf.ts](./vrf.ts) file. It does the following things:

- Initiate your wallet based on the seed phrase you set in the `.env` file
- Initialize VRF client to interact with the VRF contract.
- Create a random request with an arbitrary input (you can modify this input as you please)
- Polling and wait for the random value to be generated by the runners.
- Print out the result.
